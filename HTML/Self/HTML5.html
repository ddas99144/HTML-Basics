        <h2>Section Heading</h2>
        <p>This is the section Para. According to W3C's HTML5 documentation, <i><b>a section is a thematic grouping of content,typically with a heading.</b></i>
        <br />
        <br />
        A home page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

        <h3>Article Heading</h3>
        <p>This is the article Para. An <i><b>&ltarticle&gt</b></i> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
        <br />
        <br />
        An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.</p>

        <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanMainCharacters">An on-off pirate captain, who is or isn't mad due his Obfuscating Stupidity. His fondness of freedom, love of rum and good portion of randomness makes him a total Wild Card, so you can never predict what he will say or do next. Everything he does varies from very dangerous to just plain weird. How does he stay alive, then? Indy Ploy, Speed Chess or just dumb luck? No-one knows. What we do know, is that you'll need to keep a close eye on your wallet (and ship), because he certainly isn't stupid; in fact, he is a Magnificent Bastard who's simply waiting for a proper opportunity to strike. Oh yeah, he can parley himself out of any deal or use people to his advantage... almost.</a>
